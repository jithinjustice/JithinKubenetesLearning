kubernetes
Master Architectue
1)api server
it is responsible for exposing various api's.kubernetes is highly api centered.it forms the frontend 
or gatekeeper for the entire cluster.
kubectl - very tiny go language binary,which basically talks to api server.
2)scheduler - it is responsible for physically scheduling the artifacts(containers or pods)across multiple nodes.
 it will look for the appr nodes that meets the criteria and schedule the pods appro.
3)Controller - It is resposible for overall coordination and health of the cluster.it will ensure that nodes
are up and running and pods are behaving the right way and desired state is maintained all the time.
4)etcd - it is key-value database which is light weight developed by coreOS.it is the central db where we
will store the current cluster state.

Nodes Architecture
1)Kube proxy - Responsible for maintaining the entire network configuration.it manipulates ip tables on
each nodes each host to make sure that n/w conf is intact.one pod can talk to another pod.one node can
talk to another node.one container to another container.it also exposes services.it ensures the communication 
is maintained effectively across all the elements of the cluster.
2)kubelet - it is the agent responsible for talking to the api and master will talk to kubelet,metrix,health
and current state of node to etcd and kube master.

both docker and kubelet packag ed to supervisord layer.supervisord is a process manager layer where we can run
multiple processes inside one parent process.
fluentd - responsible for logs and central logging mechanism.
nodes are responsible for running multiple pods.
nodes also runs add-ons like dns,ui.
